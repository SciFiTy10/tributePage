**Welcome to my readme.md file!**
=================================

**Purpose:**

This project is a playground for me to tinker around with branching and merging.

**Goals:**

I want to follow best practices with naming conventions and also want to maintain
a separate development and master environment.

**For feedback:**

Please do not hesitate to message me if you see anything that looks out of place, or could be improved.

I am always looking to get better as a software developer, and I welcome any constructive criticism.
